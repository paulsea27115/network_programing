      “It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.” —Albus
      Dumbledore, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. Dumbledore, getting
      deep right from the get-go with his cautionary advice when Harry is
      looking at his family in the Mirror of Erised. “As much money and life
      as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above
      all—the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those
      things that are worst for them.” —Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter and the
      Sorcerer’s Stone. Dumbledore’s not shy with his thoughts about the
      allure of the Sorcerer’s Stone and its power.

      “Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but of your goodness, Dobby
      never knew.” —Dobby, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Dobby
      might seem like a “simple” character, but he delivers this profound
      thinker in the first scene we meet him! “Never trust anything that can
      think for itself if you can’t see where it keeps its brain!” —Arthur
      Weasley, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. For a world basically
      devoid of technology, the wizarding world still provides this solid
      cautionary message! Of course, Arthur is talking about the diary
      containing the consciousness of Lord Voldemort that Ginny fell victim
      to.

      “I am what I am, an’ I’m not ashamed. ‘Never be ashamed,’ my ol’ dad
      used ter say, ‘there’s some who’ll hold it against you, but they’re not
      worth botherin’ with.’” —Rubeus Hagrid, Harry Potter and the Goblet of
      Fire. Look at Hagrid, frequently ostracized for being a half-giant,
      doling out the self-worth quotes!

      What’s comin’ will come, an’ we’ll meet it when it does.” —Hagrid, Harry
      Potter and the Goblet of Fire. More words of wisdom from Hagrid! Harry
      takes these words to heart, and they’re reiterated as the final line of
      the book. “Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our
      aims are identical and our hearts are open.” —Albus Dumbledore, Harry
      Potter and the Goblet of Fire. To the surprise of no one, Dumbledore is
      responsible for many of the best Harry Potter quotes. “We are only as
      strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided.” —Albus Dumbledore,
      Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Dumbledore delivers some doozies in
      his final speech in Harry’s fourth year.

      Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an
      article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain
      Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that
      subject. For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day,
      the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem
      to the learned. Though the word ambergris is but the French compound for
      grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct. For amber, though
      at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far inland
      soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea. Besides,
      amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance, used for
      mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris is soft,
      waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely used in
      perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and pomatum. The
      Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for the same
      purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter's in Rome. Some wine
      merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.

      Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale
      themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick
      whale! Yet so it is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the cause, and
      by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to cure such a
      dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering three or four
      boat loads of Brandreth's pills, and then running out of harm's way, as
      laborers do in blasting rocks.
